üéà **control-flux** provide components that mimic some methods of javascript, for a pure **declarative** approach, or something like that.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## üëì Some example

You can map users and display only the right user by username
```javascript
import { Map, If } from "control-flux"

export const User = () => {
  return (
    <Map
      on={[
        { username: "Francis" },
        { username: "John" },
        { username: "Kit" }
      ]}
    >
      {user => (
        <If condition={user.username === "Francis"}>
          {user.username}
        </If>
      )}
    </Map>
  )
}
```

or display n times a component
```javascript
import { Times } from "control-flux"

export const Times = () => {
  return (
    <Times n={3}>
      <BedsIcon />
    </Times>
  )
}
```

or filter and join something like
```javascript
import { Filter, Join } from "control-flux"

export const Useless = () => {
  return (
    <Filter
      on={["really", "wtf", "amazing"]}
      predicate={v => v !== "wtf"}
    >
      {wordsFiltered => (
        <Join
          on={wordsFiltered}
          separator=" ‚úåÔ∏è "
        >
          {v => v}
        </Join>
      )}
    </Filter>
  )
}

result: really ‚úåÔ∏è amazing
```
