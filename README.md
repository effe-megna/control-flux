üéà `control-flux` provide components that mimic some methods of javascript, for a pure `declarative` approach, or something like that.

## Installation

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## üëì Some example

You can map users and display only the right user by username
<div align="center">
  <img alt="Map If" width="85%" src="assets/MapIfExample.png"/>
</div>

or display n times a component
<div align="center">
  <img alt="Times" width="85%" src="assets/TimesExample.png"/>
</div>

or filter and join something like
<div align="center">
  <img alt="Filter Join" width="85%" src="assets/FilterJoinExample.png"/>
</div>
