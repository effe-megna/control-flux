üéà **control-flux** provide components that mimic some methods of javascript, for a pure **declarative** approach, or something like that.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install control-flux.

```javascript
npm i control-flux
```

## üëì Some example

You can filter by property for display the right user
```javascript
import { FilterBy } from "control-flux"

export const User = () => {
  return (
    <FilterBy
      on={[
        { username: "Francis", type: "admin" },
        { username: "John", type: "guest" },
        { username: "Kit", type: "guest" }
      ]}
      property="username"
      predicate={username => username === "Francis"}
    >
      {user => <User {...user} /> }
    </FilterBy>
  )
}
```

or display n times a component
```javascript
import { Times } from "control-flux"

export const Times = () => {
  return (
    <Times n={3}>
      <BedsIcon />
    </Times>
  )
}
```

or filter and join
```javascript
import { Filter, Join } from "control-flux"

export const Useless = () => {
  return (
    <Filter
      on={["really", "wtf", "amazing"]}
      predicate={v => v !== "wtf"}
    >
      {wordsFiltered => (
        <Join
          on={wordsFiltered}
          separator=" ‚úåÔ∏è "
        >
          {v => v}
        </Join>
      )}
    </Filter>
  )
}

result: really ‚úåÔ∏è amazing
```
